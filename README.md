Practice and Introduction to GitHub
Hi everyone! This is my introduction to GitHub, and I'm very excited to get started on my new journey as a technical writer.
I love coffee, cooking, reading, writing, watching movies, and doing yoga. 
I worked as a journalist for several years while working in two different Virginia state agencies. In early 2021, I decided that I wanted to teach and started my MA in Teaching, but I have thought for the last few months about going more into the tech field.
